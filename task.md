# Technical Assessment – Laravel & Vue.js

Please build a simple job listing application using Laravel (backend) and Vue.js (frontend). The main use case is that a company can post jobs with minimal data (such as title and description), and candidates can view and apply.

**Requirements:**

-   A job listing page that displays all available jobs. Each listing should include the job title, company name, description, view count, and number of applications.
-   A job details page for each listing.
-   Candidates should be able to apply for a job with minimal information (e.g., name and email).
-   When a candidate applies using just an email, the company should receive an email notification.
-   Each job view should be counted, with a limit to prevent repeated counts from the same user.
-   View counting and email notifications should be efficient enough to handle high traffic.
-   The job listing and details pages should be optimized for SEO and fast loading.

**Notes:**

-   You can use dummy data with the seeder for everything.
-   UI design is not required basic and functional is fine .
-   Use Laravel for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend.
-   You can also include some basic test cases to showcase your approach and smartness This is optional but appreciated.
-   **Even if you can’t meet all the requirements, that’s totally fine. This is a proof of concept. We understand time is limited, so focus on showcasing your skills, logic, technical decisions, and use of best practices.**

**Future scope (not required, but you can consider it if you like):**

-   Companies having their own subdomains for job listings.
-   Support for custom domains where companies can host their job board.

This is just for your consideration; you don’t need to implement it, but you're welcome to showcase anything relevant.

**How to submit:**

-   Submit your assessment by creating a public GitHub repository.
-   Email us the link to the repo when you're done.
-   Please maintain regular commits so we can review your Git practices.

Add a README file with setup instructions, a summary of what you’ve implemented, and any suggestions for future improvements.
